# calculator-in-python
we developed a basic Calculator application using Tkinter and various widgets of Tkinter. 
by using python.
**Here is how our calculator will look**, 
Which is made by using the input field, buttons and for the calculation purpose we will use logic 
in our code defined in functions, like if you want to add two numbers then behind this there must be a logic for addition purpose, similarly for substraction, multiplication, etc, we have created functions whose task is to perform these operations.
